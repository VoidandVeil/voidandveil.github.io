  <h1>üåë Void & Veil</h1>

  <p><strong>Void & Veil</strong> is a name whispered rather than spoken ‚Äî a mask, a shadow, a story told by candlelight. Not one voice, but many, humming beneath the forest floor. We are hobbyists and educators, cultivators and caretakers ‚Äî each guided by the quiet lessons of old. A collective of the curious, drawn together by the strange intelligence of the mushroom.</p>

  <p>We remain anonymous not out of fear, but principle. The mushroom does not sign its name beneath the log. We are storytellers, tinkerers, educators, and curious cultivators ‚Äî sharing what we know so that others may grow with care, clarity, and a touch of mischief.</p>

  <p><em>Void</em> dreams deep. <em>Veil</em> speaks soft. Together, we light the lantern in the fog ‚Äî and show you the path not taken, the tub not yet fruited.</p>

  <p>This project is strictly for educational use. We offer no spores, no substances, no secret sellers. Just guidance and curiosity in equal measure.</p>
